# Task: Implement High-Level View Switching

## Source
- `kb/architecture/08-keybindings.md`
- `kb/architecture/07-layout-management.md`

## Todo List
- [x] Implement state transition logic for switching between `Worktree`, `Dashboard`, and `Settings`.
- [x] Map keys `1`, `2`, `3` to these transitions.
- [x] Ensure the `TabBar` correctly reflects the active view state.
- [x] Verify that switching views preserves/restores the relevant state for each view.
