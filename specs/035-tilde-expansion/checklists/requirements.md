# Specification Quality Checklist: Tilde Expansion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning
- All tilde expansion patterns (`, ~user, ~+, ~-) are well-defined
- Edge cases comprehensively documented including quoting, escaping, and nonexistent users
- Three independent user stories provide MVP path (P1) and progressive enhancement (P2, P3)
- Expansion order explicitly documented to clarify integration with existing pipeline
