## Why Archive Everything?

**Fresh Start**: Restarting rustation with new architecture and approach. Previous implementation served as learning foundation.

## Policy

**Specs are archived when:**
- Project restarts with new architecture
- Features complete without active maintenance
- No test/verification solution exists

Active development uses `specs/` directory only.
